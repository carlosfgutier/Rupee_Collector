			<p>Ganon took over the Hyrule again. Zelda is not happy and you need to buy some flowers since Ganon burned all the ones around the castle, the Gerudo, well, it's a desert, and the Zora don't really have anything but seeweeds.</p>
			<br>
			<p>The florist is picky. He will only sell you the flower if you give him the exact amount he asks. </p>
			<br>
			<p>Find and click on the rupees scattered around the field, and try to meet the price of the flowers. Match the offer to win and save the kingdom. Offer more than the asked price... Well, good Luck!</p>
